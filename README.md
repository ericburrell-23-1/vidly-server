## Purpose

This is a training project that was created while following along with a Udemy course about Node.js, creating RESTful APIs, and working with Express and MongoDB. The course was taught by Mosh Hamedani.

## Build Status

This project is completed as a training exercise, and is currently being used as a guide to continue learning and develop new server-side applications. Several notes are taken throughout the project and written as comments.

## Tests

As this was a training project that was created while following along to a course, the Unit and Integration tests were mostly created _after_ the production code was completed. Tests were only written for the genres route, and ideally would need to be written for the other routes as well for a real project. The **returns** route was created while learning test-driven development, after the other tests had been written.

## Deployment

This project was briefly deployed to a Heroku server, and connected to a free Atlas db. After it was tested, it was taken down since it has no practical purpose.

## Credits

Thank you to Mosh Hamedani for his course _Node.js: The Complete Guide to Build RESTful APIs (2018)_ on Udemy, and my girlfriend for supplying lots of support and coffee while learning to become a developer.
